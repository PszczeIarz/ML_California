Conclusion
During the project we tried to predict the median value for houses in California, USA. first, we get to know our Data better, which is a very important step in the path of understanding the problem we facing.

After understanding the problem and the tools we have in our hands (The given data) we started to Clean The Data from noise, i.e finding the best solutions for Null values and for non-numbers values.

In the moment we had our Data cleaned and the problem was bright as sun we started to search for the best Model for the Data and for the Problem.

we tried Linear, Decision Tree and Random Forest Models (Regression) and found that the best out of the trre were Random Forest Regressor.
